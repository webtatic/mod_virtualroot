mod_virtualroot - apache module to allow dynamic document roots. 

This module is similar to mod_vhost_alias's VirtualDocumentRoot, but alters
Apache's internal document root, rather than translating the current script
filename. This makes it more useful in scripting languages which need the base
path.

It also includes optional domain suffix stripping, giving the ability to reuse
the vhost under different sub-domains.

Installation
------------
make install
cp virtualroot.conf /etc/httpd/conf.d/

Usage
